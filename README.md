# Gideros Bunnymark
Quick Bunnymark Port for Gideros, and the exported Gideros template for Android Studio

Ignore the "androidstudio-export" folder unless you want to compile to an apk from Android Studio.
This is the exported template created from Gideros. 

The "html5-export" folder is the exported html5 version of the benchmark.
You can also try the HTML5 Version here https://lemon07r.github.io/gideros-bunnymark/

The rest are Gideros project files; you only need bunny.png, bunnymark.gproj and main.lua.
