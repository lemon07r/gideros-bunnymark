# gideros-bunnymark
Quick Bunnymark Port for Gideros, and the exported Gideros template for Android Studio

Ignore the "export-template" unless you want to compile to an apk with Android Studio.
This is the exported template created from Gideros. 

The html5-export folder is the exported html5 version of the benchmark, doesn't seem to work in Chrome but works fine in Edge.

The rest are Gideros project files; you only need bunny.png, bunnymark.gproj and main.lua.
