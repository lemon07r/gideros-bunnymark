# gideros-bunnymark
Quick Bunnymark Port for Gideros, and the exported Gideros template for Android Studio

Ignore the "androidstudio-export" folder unless you want to compile to an apk with Android Studio.
This is the exported template created from Gideros. 

The "docs" folder is the exported html5 version of the benchmark, doesn't seem to work in Chrome but works fine in Edge.

The rest are Gideros project files; you only need bunny.png, bunnymark.gproj and main.lua.
